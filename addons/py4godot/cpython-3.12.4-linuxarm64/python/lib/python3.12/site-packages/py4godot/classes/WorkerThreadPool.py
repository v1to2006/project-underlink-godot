class WorkerThreadPool(py4godot_object.Object):
  r'''
		The `WorkerThreadPool` singleton allocates a set of `Thread`s (called worker threads) on project startup and provides methods for offloading tasks to them. This can be used for simple multithreading without having to create `Thread`s.
		Tasks hold the `Callable` to be run by the threads. `WorkerThreadPool` can be used to create regular tasks, which will be taken by one worker thread, or group tasks, which can be distributed between multiple worker threads. Group tasks execute the `Callable` multiple times, which makes them useful for iterating over a lot of elements, such as the enemies in an arena.
		Here's a sample on how to offload an expensive function to worker threads:
		
		```gdscript
		var enemies = `` # An array to be filled with enemies.

		func process_enemy_ai(enemy_index):
			var processed_enemy = enemies`enemy_index`
			# Expensive logic...

		func _process(delta):
			var task_id = WorkerThreadPool.add_group_task(process_enemy_ai, enemies.size())
			# Other code...
			WorkerThreadPool.wait_for_group_task_completion(task_id)
			# Other code that depends on the enemy AI already being processed.
		```
		
		
		The above code relies on the number of elements in the `enemies` array remaining constant during the multithreaded part.
		**Note:** Using this singleton could affect performance negatively if the task being distributed between threads is not computationally expensive.
