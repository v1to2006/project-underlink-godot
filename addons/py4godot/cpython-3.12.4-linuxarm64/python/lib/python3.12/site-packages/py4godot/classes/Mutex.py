class Mutex(py4godot_refcounted.RefCounted):
  r'''
		A synchronization mutex (mutual exclusion). This is used to synchronize multiple `Thread`s, and is equivalent to a binary `Semaphore`. It guarantees that only one thread can access a critical section at a time.
		This is a reentrant mutex, meaning that it can be locked multiple times by one thread, provided it also unlocks it as many times.
		**Warning:** To ensure proper cleanup without crashes or deadlocks, the following conditions must be met:
		- When a `Mutex`'s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed, no threads (including the one on which the destruction will happen) must have it locked.
		- When a `Thread`'s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed, it must not have any mutex locked.
